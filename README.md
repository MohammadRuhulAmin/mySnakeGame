# mySnakeGame
This is a snake game that i developed in my University Second Semester. 
This is the First Version of Snake Game that i developed in C++ it has no Graphics or style .
After Writing the name of the player, just move the snake using W A D S , 
W is for Up S is for Down A is for Left and D is for Right,
